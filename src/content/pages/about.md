Hey there! My name is Emma, and I use she/her pronouns.

I am a beginner web developer based in New Jersey. My goal is to build simple, fun, and accessible websites for everyone.

Before I built websites, I completed a Bachelor of Music degree in clarinet performance at Ithaca College with a minor in Math and Jazz Studies. Unfortunately, a career in music isn't plausible for me anymore, so I delved into web development. 

My interest in coding began when I took an Intro to Computer Science class while working on my music degree. Now I am pursuing an Associate of Applied Science degree in Interface Design and Web Development from Raritan Valley Community College.
